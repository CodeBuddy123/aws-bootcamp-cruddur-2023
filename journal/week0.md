# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture
****
The first week of Andrew Brown's AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp was a thrilling experience, filled with valuable lessons and hands-on learning. During this week, we went over Billing and Architecture and created a diagram of the Crudder app that we are going to create.
Gather Requirements

We started by learning about the importance of gathering requirements before starting any project. This involves understanding the user's needs, business objectives, and the constraints of the project. It helps in creating a solid foundation for the project and ensures that the end product meets the user's expectations.
Conceptual Design (Napkin)

Next, we learned about the conceptual design phase, where we use simple sketches or diagrams to visualize the high-level structure of the project. This phase is also referred to as the "napkin phase" as the designs are usually created on a napkin or a piece of paper.
Logical Design (Blue Print)

We then learned about the logical design phase, where we create a more detailed blueprint of the project. This includes adding more detail to the conceptual design and determining the necessary components and their relationships.
Physical Design (Resource names)

The physical design phase involves determining the resource names and the relationships between the resources. This phase helps in creating a clear and concise picture of the architecture and helps in identifying any potential issues.

The image below is the architecture of the micro blogging app Requirements

*Application using micro services
*The frontend is in JS and the backend is in Python
*Using api to communicate
*Authentication using Cognito
*Use as much as possible the aws free tier
*Momento as a third party caching system
